## **Dynamic Forward-Forward with Sparse Local Attention (DFF-SLA) Algorithm and CUDA Implementations**

### **1. Introduction**

This report details the **Dynamic Forward-Forward with Sparse Local Attention (DFF-SLA)** algorithm, a novel approach to deep learning designed as an efficient, backpropagation-free alternative for image classification, particularly for MNIST. The algorithm's core innovations include Forward-Forward training, sparse local attention, Top-K weight updates, and dynamic capacity scaling.

To explore and validate the DFF-SLA concept, we embarked on developing CUDA kernel implementations. Our initial effort, **`dff_sla_attempt1.cu`**, served as a foundational implementation to demonstrate the basic principles of the algorithm. Recognizing the limitations and potential for optimization in this first attempt, we significantly revised and expanded upon it, leading to **`dff_sla_attempt2.cu`**. This second attempt incorporates substantial improvements in efficiency, realism, and algorithm fidelity. This report will describe the DFF-SLA algorithm, detail both CUDA implementations (`dff_sla_attempt1.cu` and `dff_sla_attempt2.cu`) highlighting the evolution from the first to the second, compare their features, and discuss the potential results and implications of this approach.

### **2. Algorithm Description: Dynamic Forward-Forward with Sparse Local Attention (DFF-SLA)**

The DFF-SLA algorithm is designed as a backpropagation-free neural network architecture, leveraging layer-wise "goodness" optimization. Its core principles are centered around efficiency, sparsity, and dynamic adaptability.

#### 2.1 Core Innovations

*   **Forward-Forward with Sparsity**: The algorithm utilizes the Forward-Forward (FF) method for training, where each layer learns to maximize a "goodness" score for positive data samples without relying on backpropagation. This is enhanced by dynamic sparse attention masks, ensuring that each neuron focuses its computation on a limited, evolving subset of inputs.
*   **Local Top-K Weight Updates**: To further boost efficiency, weight updates are localized and sparse. In each iteration, neurons only update their top 10% most influential weights, leading to significant computational savings (approximately 90%) by reducing the number of weights modified per step.
*   **Automatic Capacity Scaling**: The network dynamically adjusts its capacity by allocating neurons to classes that are proving difficult to learn. This is achieved by tracking per-class accuracy and adding neurons dedicated to underperforming classes, while pruning neurons that consistently exhibit low "goodness."

#### 2.2 Network Structure

*   **Layered Architecture**: The network consists of L layers, each containing N neurons. The initial layer width is set to 64 neurons.
*   **Sparse Attention Masks**: Each neuron in a layer is connected to only 10% of the neurons in the preceding layer. These connections are defined by randomly initialized binary masks, which are intended to evolve during training to optimize attention.
*   **Class-Specific Goodness Heads**: Each layer is equipped with per-class "goodness heads." These are likely simple logistic regression or linear units that are class-specific (( $\theta_{\ell}^{(y)}$ )). They are used to calculate a "goodness" score for each class at each layer.

#### 2.3 Forward-Forward Training Procedure

The training process for DFF-SLA, for each MNIST image (x) with label (y), involves the following steps:

*   **Positive Pass**:
    *   **Activation Calculation**: Layer activations ($a_\ell$) are computed layer by layer using the formula:
        $$ a_\ell = \sigma\left( \text{Mask}(W_\ell) \cdot a_{\ell-1} \right) $$
        where ( $\sigma$ ) is an activation function (ReLU is implied).
    *   **Per-Layer Goodness Calculation**: For the correct class (y), the goodness score ($G_\ell^{(y)}$) at each layer ( $\ell$ ) is calculated as:
        $$ G_\ell^{(y)} = \sum_{i} \text{ReLU}(a_{\ell,i}) \cdot \theta_{\ell,i}^{(y)} $$

*   **Negative Pass**:
    *   A corrupted version of the input image, ($x'$), is generated by adding random noise to (x).
    *   The same forward pass and goodness calculation are performed using ($x'$) and the same label (y) to obtain negative goodness scores ($G_\ell^{(y)}(\text{neg})$).

*   **Layer Update Rule**:
    *   **Weight Adjustment**: Weights ($W_\ell$) are updated to maximize the difference in goodness ( $\Delta G = G_\ell^{(y)}(\text{pos}) - G_\ell^{(y)}(\text{neg}) $) using a gradient-based update rule:
        $$ \Delta W_\ell = \eta \cdot \left( \nabla_{W_\ell} G_\ell^{(y)}(\text{pos}) - \nabla_{W_\ell} G_\ell^{(y)}(\text{neg}) \right) $$
    *   **Top-K Sparsity**: Only the weights corresponding to the top 10% of largest absolute values in ( $|\Delta W_\ell| $) are updated, implementing sparse and localized weight changes.

#### 2.4 Dynamic Capacity Allocation

*   **Per-Class Accuracy Tracking**: The algorithm tracks per-class accuracy using exponential moving averages to monitor learning progress for each class.
*   **Neuron Addition**: If the accuracy for a class falls below 95%, 4 new neurons are added to the network, specifically "dedicated" to improving the representation of that class.
*   **Neuron Pruning**: Neurons with consistently low average goodness scores (below 0.1 over 100 samples) are pruned to remove ineffective units and optimize network size.

#### 2.5 Prediction Mechanism

For prediction, the algorithm aggregates votes from each layer based on their goodness scores. The final prediction probability for class (y) is calculated as:

$$
P(y) = \sum_{\ell=1}^L \text{softmax}(G_\ell^{(y)})
$$

The class with the highest probability ($P(y)$) is selected as the predicted class.


### **3. CUDA Kernel Implementations**

To explore and evaluate the DFF-SLA algorithm, we developed two distinct CUDA kernel implementations: `dff_sla_attempt1.cu` and `dff_sla_attempt2.cu`. The first, `dff_sla_attempt1.cu`, was conceived as an initial, exploratory attempt, while the second, `dff_sla_attempt2.cu`, represents a significantly enhanced and optimized version.

#### **3.1 `dff_sla_attempt1.cu` - Initial Exploration**

`dff_sla_attempt1.cu` was our first attempt to translate the DFF-SLA algorithm into a CUDA kernel implementation. It aimed to provide a basic, functional demonstration of the core components, focusing on clarity and modularity as a starting point.

*   **Key Features of Attempt 1:**
    *   **Basic DFF Structure**: Implemented a multi-layer DFF network using `DFFLayer` and `DFFNetwork` classes, laying the groundwork for the algorithm's structure.
    *   **Sparse Layers**: Included sparse connectivity using binary masks within the `forwardKernel`, demonstrating the sparse attention concept in a rudimentary form.
    *   **Separate Forward/Update Kernels**: Utilized distinct CUDA kernels for each core operation â€“ `forwardKernel` for the forward pass, `computeGoodnessKernel` for goodness calculation, and `updateWeightsKernel` for weight updates. This modular approach was chosen for initial clarity.
    *   **Rudimentary Dynamic Capacity Adjustment**: Incorporated a basic dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism within `DFFLayer::adjustCapacity`. This initial version simply re-initialized neurons with low "goodness," serving as a preliminary exploration of dynamic allocation.
    *   **Simulated Random Data**: For ease of initial testing and to focus on kernel functionality, `dff_sla_attempt1.cu` used simulated MNIST-like data (random floats) instead of the actual MNIST dataset. This was a simplification for this first attempt.

*   **CUDA Kernels in `dff_sla_attempt1.cu`**:
    *   `forwardKernel`: Performed a basic forward pass for a single layer, applying sparse masks and ReLU activation.
    *   `computeGoodnessKernel`: Calculated the goodness score, using atomic addition for aggregation, again in a straightforward manner.
    *   `updateWeightsKernel`: Implemented weight updates based on the goodness difference, with a simple threshold for update magnitude and consideration of the sparse mask.

#### **3.2 `dff_sla_attempt2.cu` - Significant Revision and Optimization**

Building upon the foundational `dff_sla_attempt1.cu`, we undertook a significant revision to create **`dff_sla_attempt2.cu`**. This second attempt aimed to address the limitations of the first, focusing on enhancing efficiency, incorporating more sophisticated algorithm components, and enabling realistic training on the MNIST dataset. `dff_sla_attempt2.cu` represents a substantial advancement towards a practical and performant implementation of DFF-SLA.

*   **Key Features of Attempt 2:**
    *   **Optimized and Fused Kernels**:  To improve performance, `attempt2.cu` employs fused CUDA kernels like `fusedForwardKernel` and `fusedGoodnessKernel`. These kernels combine computations for positive and negative passes into single kernels, reducing kernel launch overhead and improving data locality.
    *   **Implementation of Top-K Weight Updates**: A major addition in `attempt2.cu` is the implementation of Top-K weight updates. This was achieved using the Thrust library for efficient sorting and selection of the top weight changes within the `topKWeightUpdateKernel`, realizing a core efficiency feature of DFF-SLA.
    *   **Refined Dynamic Capacity Allocation**: The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism was significantly refined in `attempt2.cu`, now featuring neuron pruning based on average goodness scores and layer resizing in the `dynamicCapacityAllocation` function. This provides a more robust and adaptive capacity management.
    *   **Integration with MNIST Dataset**: `dff_sla_attempt2.cu` is designed to load and train on the actual MNIST dataset from binary files, enabling realistic performance evaluation and benchmarking. This is a critical step up from the simulated data used in `attempt1.cu`.
    *   **Margin-Based Loss Function**:  `attempt2.cu` incorporates a margin-based loss function for training, moving beyond the basic goodness maximization of `attempt1.cu` to a more refined training objective.
    *   **Layer Struct for Organization**: To improve code structure and readability, `attempt2.cu` introduces a `Layer` struct to organize layer-specific data, making the codebase more manageable and scalable.

*   **CUDA Kernels in `dff_sla_attempt2.cu`**:
    *   `computeDeltaKernel`:  Dedicated kernel to calculate weight update deltas efficiently.
    *   `topKWeightUpdateKernel`: Implements the crucial Top-K weight update, using Thrust for performance.
    *   `fusedForwardKernel`:  Combines forward pass calculations for positive and negative inputs for efficiency.
    *   `fusedGoodnessKernel`:  Efficiently computes goodness for both passes, leveraging shared memory for intra-block reduction.
    *   `updateThetaKernel`:  Updates the class-specific theta values based on the margin-based loss and activation differences.
