Day 21: Tried writing a full CNN kernel for MNIST database but failed lots of times 

Failure 1: Failed to compile, Problems in Indexing
Faliure 2,3,4,5,6,7: Failed to compile memory corruption
Faliure 8,9: Compiled successfully but model stalling after some time 

-- Decided not worth my time so started asking chatgpt but my code was so big that it wasn't able to answer --

Try 10: Broke the kernel into many different kernels
Faliure 10: Wasn't able to figure out how to integrate them together
