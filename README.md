# 100-daysofcuda
 Kernels Written for 100 days of CUDA Challenge

**Day 1:** Wrote a Naive Matmul kernel

**Day 2:** Wrote a 1D tiled matmul kernel

**Day 3:** Oversimplified 2D tiled matmul kernel

**Day 4:** 2D matmul kernel with CPU verification and great memory management

**Day 5:** 3D matmul tiling!

**Day 6:** Softmax flashattention online

**Day 7:** Layer Normalization

**Day 8:** Better layer normalization with lots of nice modifications

**Day 9:** Implimented a 2D tiled convlutional kernel


**Day 10:** Implimented Vectorized matmul !! Got first Batch
