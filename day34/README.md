**Day 34: CUDA-Based Agent-Resource Simulation**

**1. Introduction**
The purpose of this project is to develop a CUDA-accelerated simulation in which agents interact with a grid-based resource environment. The simulation models agent movement, resource consumption, and starvation dynamics, providing insights into resource availability and agent survival over time.

**2. Objectives**
- Implement a high-performance agent simulation using CUDA.
- Optimize agent movement, resource consumption, and starvation mechanics.
- Improve the main function to enhance data collection and analysis.
- Ensure fair random movement probabilities and accurate starvation conditions.

**3. System Design and Implementation**
The simulation consists of the following key components:
- **Agents**: Move within the grid, consume resources, and track starvation.
- **Resource Cells**: Provide a limited amount of resources that regenerate over time.
- **CUDA Kernels**:
  - `initAgentKernel`: Initializes agent positions, desires, and states.
  - `initResourceKernel`: Sets up resource cells with randomized values.
  - `agentKernel`: Governs agent behavior, including movement and resource extraction.
  - `regenKernel`: Handles resource regeneration with environmental factors.

**4. Key Fixes and Optimizations**
- **Starvation Condition Logic**:
  - Previously, agents starved if any resource was insufficient.
  - Fix: Agents now starve only when all required resources are below a threshold.

- **Random Movement Probabilities**:
  - Earlier implementation led to biased movement.
  - Fix: Probabilities now use precise fractions (1/3 and 2/3) to ensure equal distribution.

- **Performance Enhancements**:
  - CUDA error handling added.
  - Reduced redundant memory accesses.
  - Optimized memory transfers for improved efficiency.

**5. Results and Analysis**
To track the systemâ€™s behavior, the main function was enhanced to periodically report key statistics:
- Number of alive agents.
- Average reward collected by agents.
- Average resource levels in the environment.

During the simulation, data is collected every 100 iterations and at the final iteration, providing a clearer understanding of agent survival trends and resource depletion patterns.

**6. Conclusion**
This project successfully leverages CUDA to create a parallelized agent-resource simulation. The implemented fixes ensure fair resource consumption and movement probabilities, while the enhanced main function improves observability. The results demonstrate how resource availability and agent survival are interdependent, providing a foundation for further ecological and AI-driven simulations.

**7. Future Work**
- Introduce agent cooperation and competition strategies.
- Implement additional resource management policies.
- Optimize memory usage for larger-scale simulations.
- Visualize simulation dynamics for better interpretability.

This project highlights the power of CUDA in simulating complex multi-agent environments efficiently, offering potential applications in ecological modeling, reinforcement learning, and artificial life simulations.
